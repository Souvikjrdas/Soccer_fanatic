            <pre id="text">
    In the first decade of the 20th century, Manchester United played their home matches at a 50,000-stadium at Bank Street, when then president Davies began
    planning for a new stadium with double that capacity. A site was chosen near Trafford Park industrial estate, and architect Archibald Leitch was appointed
    to design the stadium.Old Trafford officially opened on 19 February 1910 with a match between Manchester and Liverpool (3-4). The stadium at that time 
    consisted of one covered seating stand and open terraces on the other three sides. Capacity was slightly over 80,000.
    Few changes were made to the stadium until the construction of a roof over the United Road terrace in 1934.
    In 1939, Old Trafford recorded its highest attendance of 76,962 during an FA Cup semi-final match between Wolves and Grimsby Town.
    Due to its proximity to Trafford Park industrial estate, Old Trafford got heavily damaged by German air raids during World War 2. It took eight years 
    to rebuilt the stadium,the delays being caused by limited post-war resources, and during that time United played at Maine Road, the ground of rivals
    Manchester City.In 1949, Man United moved back to a reconstructed, though smaller, Old Trafford. Incremental improvements and expansions were made 
    in the following decades, which culminated in the complete renovation of the United Road (North) Stand in the 1960s. This stand also held the first 
    private boxes to be constructed at a British ground.Old Trafford was one of the playing venues of the 1966 World Cup, during which it hosted three 
    group matches. In those years, the capacity of the stadium fluctuated around 60,000.
    Old Trafford got gradually further improved in the 1970s and 1980s, including new and better cover, increased seating areas, and improved executive 
    facilities. At the same time, however, the rise of hooliganism also resulted in the installation of security fences separating the stands from the 
    pitch.In the early 1990s, plans were made to convert the stadium into an all-seater. This involved the demolition and replacement of the famous 
    Stretford End terraces and the placement of seats in the lower-tiers of the other stands.
    Old Trafford got selected to be one of the playing venues of the 1996 European Championships, and as a result a new North Stand opened in 1995. 
    By the start of Euro 1996 the stadium could hold about 56,000 fans.During the Euro 1996 tournament, Old Trafford hosted three group matches, 
    a quarter-final,and the semi-final between the Czech Republic and France (0-0).
    In the years following, second tiers were added to the East and West Stand, raising capacity to 68,000 seats.
    In 2006, the stadium reached its current capacity when stands got built in the upper-tier corners on both sides of the North Stand.
    Old Trafford hosted its only European final in 2003, when the Champions League final between Milan and Juventus (0-0) was played at the stadium.
    In 2011, the stadium’s North Stand got renamed Sir Alex Ferguson Stand in honour of the club’s long-time manager.
    Old Trafford’s South Stand remains the only two-tiered stand of the stadium, but expansion possibilities are limited due to the railway line that 
    runs behind the stand.While Man United has indicated that a further expansion to 95,000 seats remains a possibility, no concrete plans exist at 
    the moment.

        Barça's new stadium replaced their old ground of Les Corts which with a capacity of just 48,000 was too small to accomodate the interest generated 
        by a team led by Hungarian star Ladislao Kubala.The stadium was designed by architects Francesc Mitjans Miró and Josep Soteras Mauri, with the 
        collaboration of Lorenzo García Barbón,and it was constructed between 1955 and 1957, using mainly concrete and iron. The whole project cost a 
        staggering 288 million pesetas, which meant the club would spend the following years heavily in debt.Although it was originally going to go under 
        the official name of ‘Estadi del FC Barcelona’,it soon came to be popularly known as the 'Camp Nou' (the ‘new ground’), as opposed to the club’s 
        old home at Les Corts. It was not until the 2000/2001 season that,following a postal vote made by the Club membership,that the decision was made 
        to make ‘Camp Nou’ the official name of the stadium. Of the 29,102 votes the club received, a total of 19,861 (68.25%) preferred Camp Nou to 
        Estadi del FC Barcelona.The stadium’s maximum height is 48 metres, and it covers a surface area of 55,000 
        square metres (250 metres long and 220 metres wide).In accordance with UEFA stipulations, the playing area has been downsized to 105 metres x 68 
        metres.With a capacity of 99,354, it is now the biggest stadium in Europe. However, the total capacity has varied over the years owing to 
        different modifications.When it was first opened in 1957,it held 93,053 spectators, which would be increased to 120,000 in 1982 on occasion of 
        the FIFA World Cup. However, the introduction of new regulations outlawing standing areas reduced the stadium’s capacity in the late 1990s to 
        just under 99,000.In the 1998-99 season, UEFA recognised the services and facilities at Camp Nou by awarding it five star status. In 2010, 
        in line with the new UEFA regulations, this category was replaced by the new 'Category 4' title which corresponds to the stadiums which 
        fulfill the most demanding requirements with regards to facilities, services and capacity such as FC Barcelona's ground.Of the different 
        facilities on offer inside the stadium, of particular note are a chapel next to the changing rooms, the presidential box, the VIPs lounge,
        the press rooms,several television studios, the Sports Medicine Centre, the Operative Control Unit (UCO), the veteran players area, 
        the FC Barcelona club museum,and the offices of all of the many different Club departments.

        <pre id="text">
        Stamford Bridge officially opened on the 28th of April 1877, but for the next 28 years mainly served as an athletics venue.
        The owners, however, wanted a stadium that could host professional football, and hired architect Archibald Leitch to design a new stadium. 
        Stamford Bridge got almost completely rebuilt in 1905,and was subsequently offered to Fulham FC. Fulham turned the offer down though, and 
        newly formed Chelsea FC moved in instead.Stamford Bridge at that time consisted of one covered seating stand and a vast open bowl of 
        terraces covering the other three sides. An estimated 100,000 people could fit into the stadium.Few changes were made until 1930, when new 
        terraces were built at the Shed End, and, nine years later, when a small seating stand was built at the North End.Stamford Bridge recorded 
        its highest attendance in 1935 during a match against Arsenal when a total of 82,905 fans attended the match.
        In 1965, the terraces of the West Stand were replaced by a new covered seating stand. Redevelopments continued in the mid 1970s when the 
        old main stand was demolished and replaced by the new East Stand.The construction of the new East Stand turned out to have such an effect 
        on Chelsea’s finances though, that the club was almost forced into bankruptcy. The Stamford Bridge site was sold to property developers in 
        order to pay off some debts, which almost resulted in Chelsea being evicted and forced to ground share with Fulham or QPR.The club finally 
        won back ownership in 1992, however no changes were made in the years in between. In the meantime, the Taylor 
        report had been published and Stamford Bridge was in urgent need for redevelopment.Works started in 1994 with the demolition of the North 
        terraces, which were replaced with a new seating stand. Soon after, the Shed End terraces suffered the same fate.Reconstruction of the West 
        Stand started in 1997 and was, with some delays, completed in 2001.At the same time the East Stand had undergone an extensive refurbishment.
        Despite all of this, Stamford Bridge is still a ground with limitations in terms of capacity and facilities, and in the last decade Chelsea 
        have therefore sought to either expand Stamford Bridge or build a new stadium altogether.Expansion of the current 
        ground turned out to be too complicated with the stadium being hemmed in by housing, and initially the club therefore explored different 
        sites in West London for the construction of a new stadium,most notably the site of the Battersea Power Station, though their bid for the 
        site failed in 2012.Following their failed Battersea bid,the club directed their attention back to the Stamford Bridge site, and in 2015 
        announced plans for the construction of a complete new stadium. Later that year,the first 
        images were presented of a 60,000 all-seater designed by Herzog & De Meuron architects.The project, estimated to come at a cost of over 
        £500 million, got approved by the local city council and major of London in early 2017. The club 
        currently hope to move into their new home before the start of the 2021-22 season. During the works, they would have to play their home 
        matches elsewhere. Both Wembley Stadium and Twickenham have been named as possible options.

        The Santiago Bernabéu Stadium (Spanish: Estadio Santiago Bernabéu, [esˈtaðjo sanˈtjaɣo βeɾnaˈβew] (About this soundlisten)) is a football 
        stadium in Madrid, Spain.With a current seating capacity of 81,044,[5] it has been the home stadium of Real Madrid since its completion 
        in 1947.[2] It is the second-largest stadium in Spain and third-largest home to a top-flight European club after Camp Nou and Westfalenstadion.
        Named after footballer and former Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabéu, the stadium is one of the world's most famous football venues. 
        It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980, 2010.[6] The stadium also hosted the 
        second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Finals,making Santiago Bernabéu the first (and only) stadium to host the two most important premier 
        continental cup finals (UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores).The final matches for the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the 1982 
        FIFA World Cup were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a UEFA Euro final and a FIFA World Cup final.

        The Emirates Stadium replaced Arsenal’s previous home Highbury, which had become too small and lacked the possiblities for expansion being 
        hemmed in by housing.First plans for the construction of a new stadium were made in the late 1990s, but also a move to the new Wembley 
        Stadium was considered.In the end a site was chosen just a few hundred yards away from Highbury, and, after a few delays, construction of 
        the stadium started in 2004. The total project budget amounted to £390 million.
        The Emirates Stadium officially opened on the 23rd of July 2006. The first match was a testimonial match for Dennis Bergkamp featuring an 
        Arsenal and Ajax side.Due to the competition of nearby Wembley Stadium, the Emirates Stadium has never hosted the English national team, 
        however the Brazilian national team has regularly staged friendlies at the stadium.

    The Allianz Arena replaced Munich’s old Olympiastadion. First plans for a new stadium were made in 1997, and even though the city of Munich 
    initially preferred reconstructing the Olympiastadion, they eventually went ahead with the clubs’ proposal for an entire new stadium.
    Construction of the Allianz Arena started in October 2002, with a total investment in the project of €340 million.
    The first match at the stadium, between TSV 1860 and 1. FC Nürnberg (3-2), was played on the 30th of May 2005. One day later Bayern played 
    a friendly against the German national team (4-2).The Allianz Arena was one of the playing venues of the 2006 World Cup. During the 
    tournament it hosted, among others, the opening match between Germany and Costa Rica (4-2) and the semi-final between France and Portugal 
    (1-0).In 2012, the Allianz Arena was the host of the Champions League final between Chelsea and Bayern (1-1).
    In recent years, the arena was first expanded with an additional 3,000 seats and then by another 6,000 seats, mainly by creating extra 
    space at the top of the upper tier and implementing optimisations to the stands.While the Allianz Arena soon turned out to be too small 
    for Bayern, TSV found it more difficult to fill the arena, and struggled with the high rental costs.In 2006, they sold their stake in the 
    arena to Bayern and went on to agree a lease contract. However, they never felt completely at home and in 2017 decided 
    to move back to Grunwalder Stadion, which had been their home until 1995.The Allianz Arena will be one of the playing venues of the 
    Euro 2020 tournament, hosting three group matches and one quarter-final, and is also one of the playing venues of the Euro 2024 tournament.
